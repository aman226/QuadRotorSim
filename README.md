## About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a quadrotor simulator that I am working on. It is a work in progress. I am using this project to learn about quadrotor dynamics and control. Right now LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) control is implemented and is working. I am working on implementing MPC (Model Predictive Control) and other control methods. The current model is a simple point mass model.
